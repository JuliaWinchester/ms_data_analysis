My PhD project is looking at morphological evolution and modularity in living and extinct amphibians and early tetrapods using 3D morphometrics. In this project, I will be constructing a large 3-D surface morphometric dataset to investigate evolutionary rates, morphological disparity, and phenotypic modularity   through time. This morphological data will be analysed to determine how modularity influences patterns and processes of amphibian evolution and how it interacts with extrinsic factors such as large scale biotic events. Disparity and rates of evolution will be determined using a phylogenetic framework and these can be compared across the three amphibian clades, as well as relating these to phenotypic integration. This project is part of a collaborative research project which will ultimately analyse morphological changes of key structures (skull, limbs and jaw) throughout the whole tetrapod lineage.
 
I aim to gather a large dataset of CT and laser scans with a sampling of roughly the subfamily level and genus level where possible. I will focus primarily on crania but also limbs and lower jaws where available. Using the CT and laser scans, 3D surface morphometric data will be collected for each specimen using homologous landmarks and sliding semi-landmarks to represent the complex morphology of the skull as completely as possible across such a diverse group of organisms. 
I would be very grateful if I could please use your CT scan in my dataset, since this will allow me to increase the phylogenetic breadth of my dataset. A large dataset is vital for my analyses as it will allow me to address many important topics in amphibian evolution, such as survivorship and selectivity over mass extinctions, trends in modularity, and the effect of ecology and life history on diversification.

Rather than making numerous (ad nauseum) requests for downloading different specimens of the Herpetology collections, I thought it might be more efficient to ask once for access to any of these materials.

In order to compare with the fossil materal, the extant taxa are in great need to determine the systematic position of the fossil material. I am very greatful if you can allow me to download there mesh files of Varanus prasinus. It will be of great help to my research on the fossil varanid of China. Thank you very very much!
And Happy New Year!!!
